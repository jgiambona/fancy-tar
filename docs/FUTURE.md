## Per-File Archiving Rules via Config File

### Overview

Introduce a configuration system that allows users to specify rules for handling files based on their names or patterns when creating archives. This enables automatic application of settings such as encryption, recipient selection, archive format, and compression options for specific files or file types.

---

### Use Case Examples

- **Encrypt all `.sql` files for a specific recipient.**
- **Use a different archive format for files named `ABC123.txt`.**
- **Apply custom compression settings to log files.**

---

### Proposed Config File Format

Use a YAML (or JSON) file to define rules. Each rule includes:
- A filename pattern (glob or regex).
- Settings to apply when a file matches the pattern.

**Example (`.fancytar.yml`):**
```yaml
rules:
  - pattern: "*.sql"
    encrypt: true
    recipient: "alice@example.com"
    format: "tar.gz"
    compression: "xz"
  - pattern: "ABC123.txt"
    encrypt: true
    recipient: "bob@example.com"
    format: "zip"
    compression: "deflate"
```

---

### Implementation Plan

1. **Config File Loading**
   - On archive creation, load a config file (default: `.fancytar.yml` in the working directory, or as specified by CLI).

2. **Rule Matching**
   - For each file to be archived, check if its name matches any rule's pattern using glob or regex matching.
   - If multiple rules match, apply the first match or allow for rule priority/merging.

3. **Settings Application**
   - Apply the matched rule's settings (encryption, recipient, format, compression, etc.) when processing the file.
   - If no rule matches, use default/global settings.

4. **CLI Integration**
   - Allow CLI options to override config file settings if specified.

5. **Feedback and Logging**
   - Optionally, log or display which rules were applied to which files for transparency.

---

### Extensibility

- **Additional Criteria:** Support matching on file size, directory, or other attributes.
- **More Actions:** Add support for exclusion, custom metadata, or post-processing hooks.
- **Rule Priority:** Allow users to specify rule order or explicit priorities.

---

### Example Workflow

1. User runs:
   ```
   fancytar create archive.tar file1.sql ABC123.txt notes.txt
   ```
2. The tool loads `.fancytar.yml`.
3. It matches `file1.sql` to the first rule, `ABC123.txt` to the second, and `notes.txt` to none (uses defaults).
4. It applies the specified settings for each file as it adds them to the archive.

---

### Technical Notes

- **YAML Parsing:** Use a library such as PyYAML (Python) or equivalent.
- **Pattern Matching:** Use `fnmatch` or `glob` for glob patterns, or regex for advanced matching.
- **Backward Compatibility:** If no config file is present, fall back to current behavior.

---

### Open Questions

- Should rules be allowed to merge, or is first-match sufficient?
- Should there be a dry-run or verbose mode to preview rule application?
- How should errors in the config file be handled?

---

### Status

**Planned** â€” Not yet implemented.

## Implementation Priority

Features are listed in rough order of priority, but actual implementation order may vary based on:
- User demand
- Technical feasibility
- Dependencies between features
- Available development resources

## Version Planning

Future versions will focus on implementing these features in logical groups:

- v1.7.x: Bug fixes and improvements to core features.
- v1.8.x: Focus on file selection and management features
- v1.9.x: Focus on security and encryption enhancements
- v2.0.x: Focus on user experience and integration features
